- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dipak, an experimental condensed matter physicist by day and a passionate software developer by night.
- In parallel to my research, I dedicate my free time to developing tools and automating processes within the experimental condensed matter physics domain.
- This repository serves as a collection of my open-source projects to enhance efficiency and reproducibility in experimental physics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving deep into the world of machine learning and exploring its potential applications in condensed matter physics.
